# Azure IoT WS - Part 3

> In this lab we will add an route to Event Hubs upon a rule that acts on alerts from the device. Once in Event Hubs we add a logic app to trigger and send a mail to the customer alerting her of high usage. We also use Device Twins to change the ingest rate for telemetry.

### Add Event Hubs and route

1. Create a new Event Hub account in your resource group.
1. Add an event hub to the namespace.
1. Optional: add a consumer group.
1. In the IoT Hub, add an Endpoint to the Event Hub you created above.
1. Add a Route to the endpoint, add a condition to route messages with a user property `usagealert='true'`.

### Simulator

1. Add a Message property `usagealert` with a value of `true` to a random or calculated message. 
_Note: Message properties are strings, so your condition needs to match to a string value._

1. Use the simulator to ingest telemetry. Make sure one of the messages triggers the property to be added to one or more messages.
1. Validate the Event Hub is receiving messages that match the condition (you can use the Metrics data for the Event Hub to get numbers of messages coming in). This should validate your route is working.

### Add a Logic App to alert customer

1. Create a new Logic app
1. Add a Trigger for messages coming from an Event Hub
1. Select your Event Hub (you'll need to go to advanced properties to add a Consumer group name if you created one)
1. By default the trigger will look for new messages every 3 minutes. During dev you can put this to 1 minute.
1. Add an action to send e-mail via Office 365 or another connector of your choice.
1. For the receiver, as this is for testing and we don't to spam anyone, enter your own e-mail address (static value).
1. For the message body, you can leverage the Dynamic content from the previous step. To retrieve the Message's body, use `[Content]` Dynamic property. Note: if you want to parse the Json you can add a step before this action to Parse JSON. For this you will need the schema of the message.
    1. Additionally the Message body is encoded so to parse the JSON you will need to go into code view of the logic app, and use the following expression in the Content field: `@{base64ToString(triggerBody()?['ContentData'])}`.
1. Enable the Logic App.
1. Run the Trigger. If there are messages in the Event Hub it should fire the trigger. You can verify runs by viewing the Trigger History. You should now get an e-mail in your inbox. 
1. Note: you might want to disable the Logic App to stop receiving e-mails.

### Device Twins

1. Use an app, Device Explorer or the Azure Portal's device explorer to set the telemetry rate property. Use the Desired property for this.
1. In the Simulator app, react to Device Twin change and adapt the telemetry send rate to the value received.
1. Once the rate goes up, you should be able to see values at higher rate coming into Time Series Insights (Scenario is an operator will be able to dive into much more granular info).
1. Optional: use the Desired property again to set the rate back to every 10 seconds for example.


### Optional: make it more real with a customer's e-mail address

You could leverage a custom function or Stream Analytics with reference data containing Customer information. Create a new Event with a message body that contains the customer e-mail and only then get the Logic App to run. In this case you can keep the Route's condition but you might be sending it to Stream Analytics first instead of directly to the Logic App.
